Some packages recommend using `conda` for installation on Google Colab. Here is a quick guide to doing so.

See [How to install / use Conda on Google Colab](https://inside-machinelearning.com/en/how-to-install-use-conda-on-google-colab/), a guide to installing Conda when using Google Colab.

Check to see if conda is already installed:

```py
!conda --version
```

You should get the error, `/bin/bash: conda: command not found`.

Install conda:

```py
!pip install -q condacolab
import condacolab
condacolab.install()
```

Note that the kernel will reboot and you will see an error stating that *Your session crashed for an unknown reason.* It is okay to dismiss this notice.

Confirm that installation was successful:

```py
!conda --version
```

You should get `conda 4.9.2`. 

!!! success

Now you can use conda for installation of other packages that are not available by `pip` or that run better after installation with `conda`.
