This section covers the course *Practical Molecular Dynamics*. This course will mostly use Google Colaboratory, but other free, cloud-based solutions to the need for computing resources will be introduced as needed. The course is designed around the use of Jupyter notebooks that run on Google Colaboratory. The course notebooks are available at the Molecular Dynamics GitHub repository, and the course contents can be viewed at the Molecular Dynamics website.
