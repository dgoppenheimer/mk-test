# Analysis of MD Simulations using GROMACS

- [Molecular Modeling Practical](http://www.cgmartini.nl/~mdcourse/analysis1.html): This site has some simple analyses, but good explanations of GROMACS commands and good questions.
- [Protein-related items](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019-rc1/reference-manual/analysis/protein-related.html): Some protein analyses including secondary structure changes over time, Ramachandran plots, and an Î±-helical wheel projection of your protein.
