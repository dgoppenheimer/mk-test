# Analysis of MD Simulations Using AMBER

## Resources

- [AMBER Tutorial](https://ambermd.org/tutorials/analysis/tutorial_notebooks/nglview_notebook/index.html): This tutorial uses a Jupyter notebook and focuses on:

>Interactive data analysis with NGLView, pytraj and Jupyter notebook

- [RMSD/RMSF Analysis](https://ctlee.github.io/BioChemCoRe-2018/rmsd-rmsf/): This tutorial also uses a Jupyter notebook for analysis. There are some nice analyses in this tutorial.

>Summary: In this analysis tutorial, you will learn how to use AMBER's cpptraj module to calculate the RMSD and RMSF of a system. You will learn the definitions of these terms and when and how to use them in your data analysis. Additionally, you will hone your python skills in generating files, running scripts, extracting data from files and plotting with matplotlib.

- [Using VMD with AMBER](http://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial2/): Basic tutorial, but may have some useful parts. From 2015.
