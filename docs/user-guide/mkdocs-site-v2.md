## Customizing the Site

### Add an `extra.css` file

See [How do I specify custom primary color for mkdocs-material?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63017898/how-do-i-specify-custom-primary-color-for-mkdocs-material)  
And [Changing the colors](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/)  
And [Customization](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/)



## Create a Landing Page

[How to add a landing page to a mkdocs doc site using mkdocs-material?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63438788/how-to-add-a-landing-page-to-a-mkdocs-doc-site-using-mkdocs-material)

Create an `overrides` directory

Reference this in `mkdocs.yml`

```yaml
 theme:
   custom_dir: overrides
```

Since the custom directory is declared, you need to change 

```py
{% extends "overrides/main.html" %}
```

to

```py
{% extends "main.html" %}
```

in `main-styles.html` and `main.html`

okay, I got most of the home page stuff shown on [Binbash Leverageâ„¢ Documentation](https://leverage.binbash.com.ar/)

Now I need to customize it.

Start with the footer.

Compare it to the Material footer.

Try and replace the bin bash items with the material items.

need `overrides/assets/stylesheets` directory
 add the css files

The image is a bit too far to the right
search the css file in the overrides directory 
 change .mdx-hero__image{order:1;transform:translateX(1rem);

 from 4rem to 1rem to move the image to the left a bit

In the `home.html` file there is reference to `config.site_description` that has some text in it. The precedes the text: `Set up in 5 minutes`. It is not clear why the `Set up in 5 minutes` text was not added to `config.site_description`, or why the text in `config.site_description` was not added to `home.html`. Now there are two files to change for the same block of text. 

The `config.site_description` refers to the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml
site_description: >-
  Create a branded static site from a set of Markdown files to host the
  documentation of your Open Source or commercial project
```

Add some more stuff to the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml
site_author: David G Oppenheimer
site_description: >-
  Notes on carrying out and analyzing the results from molecular dynamics simulations

# Copyright
copyright: Copyright &copy; 2022 David G Oppenheimer
```

### Remove the `Get Insiders` Button

Delete the following from `home.html`:

```html
    <a href="{{ 'insiders/' | url }}" title="Material for MkDocs Insiders" class="md-button">
      Get Insiders
    </a>
```

### Change Text on the Landing Page

In `home.html`, make the following changes:

Remove the `Set up in 5 minutes.` text.  
Change `Technical documentation that just works` to `Molecular dynamics simulations for fun and profit`  
Change `Quick Start` to `Get Started`.

Test the site on GitHub.
